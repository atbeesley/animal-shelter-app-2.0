# animal-shelter-app-2.0

This is an app for a member of staff working at an intergalactic animal shelter to be able to keep track of their animals (those already sheltered, as well as those awaiting adoption) as well as their customers.

To run this app in your browser, you'll first of all need to open Terminal (or whichever Command Line interface your system has). 

1) In Terminal, run the command: git clone https://github.com/animal-shelter-app-2.0 animal_shelter_app 

This will save a copy of this git repo in your user. 

2) Next, in Terminal run the command: cd animal_shelter_app 

and then 

cd animal-shelter

This will navigate into the newly made animal shelter app's folder. 

3) In Terminal, run the command ruby app.rb

In your browser, go to http://localhost:4567/

The app should now be running in your browser. 

May the porgs be with you!

This app was created as my first solo project in Ruby during my course at CodeClan. 

It was based on the brief below, and meets the MVP as well as the first of the possible extensions. 

Animal Shelter
The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

MVP:

A list of all their animals and their admission date

1. Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable

2. Assign an animal to a new owner

3. List all the owners and their adopted animals

Possible Extensions:

4. CRUD actions for animals/owners

5. Have separate pages for animals ready for adoption and ones still in training/vet care

6. Search for animals by breed/type

7. Any other ideas you might come up with
