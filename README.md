# animal-shelter-app-2.0

This is an app for a member of staff working at an intergalactic animal shelter to be able to keep track of their animals (those already sheltered, as well as those awaiting adoption) as well as their customers.

To run this app in your browser, you'll first of all need to open Terminal (or whichever Command Line interface your system has). 

1) In Terminal, run the command: git clone https://github.com/animal-shelter-app-2.0 animal_shelter_app 

This will save a copy of this git repo in your user. 

2) Next, in Terminal run the command: cd animal_shelter_app 

and then 

cd animal-shelter

This will navigate into the newly made animal shelter app's folder. 

3) In Terminal, run the command ruby app.rb

In your browser, go to http://localhost:4567/

The app should now be running in your browser. 


May the porgs be with you!
